				Hello!!!&#128515;
				My name is Asiimire Patricia.
				That is the official name,
				 but all through
				school I have had 
				quite a number of names.
				Some were based on my nature
				(that's when they called me
				 names like big cheeks)
				&#128514;&#128514;
				and the rest were based on
				the situations I went through.
				I have been one of those sickly
				ones and
				every time I got healed,
				I acquired names like Testimony,
				 Zoe (Christ-like life), Trish (this
				 I got it when I joined campus)
				and hope to acquire more positive names because 
				the Lord is still fighting for me more battles.
